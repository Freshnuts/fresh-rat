Remote Administration Tool

I am studing multiprocessing, sockets, and I figured this would be a fun
project!<br>I am stemming this off from freShell. This is only to be used
for Educational Purposes,<br>not for illegal purposes. <br>


Current Update: 8/21/2017
- Been busy because of irl stuff, other projects, & ctfs.<br>
- Doesn't properly close all processes when exiting program<br>


Menu: (Under Construction)

1. Shows All Targets (Done)
2. Choose Target (Done)
    - Interactive Shell (Currently Under Construction)
3. Download File (Module Completed, needs implementation)
4. Upload File (Module completed, needs implementation)
5. Exit


Note* - I am currently only using the client for debugging purposes. Haven't fleshed it out<br>
Also, I have been trying to write this same code on C side by side, having a hard time.<br>
Mainly, because everything I code is unsafe and I can buffer overflow it!<br> And the mistakes
on python + C on processing/threading is doubling my time consumption to just finish 1 project.
I think it's a better idea to focus on this and finish, THEN move to C. <br>
